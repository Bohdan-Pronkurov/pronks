Poland is the geographical neighbor of Ukraine. This country is a member of the European Union and a member of the Schengen Agreement. Often, a tourist visa to Poland for Ukrainians is a pass to another 25 countries in Europe. Also, a visa to Poland is needed to work, study or do business in Poland. To open a visa to Poland you need to know all the subtleties of paperwork and any mistake can cause a refusal. In this case, the cost of the visa does not matter. You can apply for a visa yourself or with the help of our company.

Actually, Poland is one of the most attractive countries for Ukrainians for employment. This is due to several factors at once: geographical proximity, a high level of wages, a similar mentality and, most importantly, the possibility of official employment in Poland. For Ukrainians who want to go to a neighboring country to work, a national work visa to Poland (Polish work visa category D) is provided. A national visa to Poland also gives the right to visit other countries of the European Union. At the same time, it is worth noting that entry and exit to the EU countries is possible only through the territory of Poland.
